# Decerna Sustainability Tools

Open source tools and prototypes for LCA workflows and sustainability data integration.

We're exploring how to make environmental, social, and safety data more accessible to developers and researchers. Current focus areas include OpenLCA integration, structured data formats, and experimental approaches to AI-accessible sustainability datasets.

This is early stage work. Everything here is open source and intended for the broader sustainability community to use, modify, or build upon.

## Current Projects

- OpenLCA IPC integration tools
- MCP server prototypes for sustainability data
- Data preparation utilities for LCA/S-LCA workflows

## Status

Active development. Documentation and examples being added as we go.
